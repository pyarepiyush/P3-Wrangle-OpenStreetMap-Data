# P3-Wrangle-OpenStreetMap-Data
Udacity Data Analyst NanoDegree Project3 submission

This project involves studying the map-area below from https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/san-francisco_california/ provided by OpenStreetMaps. 
The objective of this project is to parse the data, clean up any values as needed, and upload the resulting values into MongoDB for further analysis.
I chose this data because I find the city of San Francisco fascinating. So, by studying the map data of San Francisco, I wanted to see if I can discover what makes up the character of this city.
